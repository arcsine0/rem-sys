# Real Estate Monitoring System
This'll be our main repository for our group project in this course

# !!! This will be replaced by a template soon to make it easier !!!
it'll still be the same repo here, the contents will just change

## Project Setup

`[ Make sure to have Git and NodeJS installed on your system first ]`

This project is built with the React Framework because of the nature of a monitoring app. It helps with the updating of data in real time. Those that have very little experience with react, I will put a breakdown of the project as well as how to code it here in the repo.

This is just a quick rundown on how to setup and run our project. Might be helpful if you haven't used github that much yet.

Clone this repo on your local directory using the following

```
git clone https://github.com/arcsine0/rem-sys.git
```

Or if you're using Github Desktop, do `File > Clone Repo > URL > paste the same link as above`

To organize things, I made separate branches for each sections of our project. Currently, there are branches for UI, Server, and Database. Pull and push on these specific branches depending on your contribution to the project (or if you just want to).

oh yeah to pull from the branch first you gotta make sure to be on that branch

```
git checkout -b (branch name)
```

on GH Desktop simply just switch branches

then to commit and push
```
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin (branch)
```
-- please do be brief but descriptive on the commit message so we know what you updated

## Don't know or have no experience with React?
I have a tutorial / breakdown inside the client folder's README, or just click on the client folder here on github to see it. If you think this thingy may be harder than what you can do / contribute, I'd be more than happy to discuss and go with any method you can think of.

That's it! (for now)
