## Real (E?)State Monitoring System
This'll be our main repository for our group project in this course


## Project Setup

[ AS OF NOW I HAVEN'T MADE THE BASE CODE SO DON'T CLONE YET ]

This is just a quick rundown on how to setup and run our project. Might be helpful if you haven't used github that much yet.

Clone this repo on your local directory using the following

```
git clone https://github.com/arcsine0/rsm-sys.git
```

Or if you're using Github Desktop, do File > Clone Repo > URL > paste the same link as above

To organize things, I made separate branches for each sections of our project. Currently, there are branches for UI, Server, and Database. Pull and push on these specific branches depending on your contribution to the project (or if you just want to).

oh yeah to pull from the branch first you gotta make sure to be on that branch

```
git checkout -b (branch name)
```

on GH Desktop simply just switch branches

then to commit and push
```
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin (branch)
```
-- please do be brief but descriptive on the commit message so we know what you updated

That's it! (for now)
